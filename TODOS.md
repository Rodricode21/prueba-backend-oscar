# TODOS list

## I intend for this to show case how I breakdown the tasks, similar to how you'd proceed when working with a sprint and tickets

- [x] fork project
- [x] integrate environment variables
- [x] dockerize postgres instance & leave a Dockerfile
- [x] create a project readme with instructions on how to bootstrap the app and database
- [x] create a script that is run against the database and creates 10 movies & 10 options to serve as fixture data
- [x] add pagination to GET endpoints
